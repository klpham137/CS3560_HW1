# CS3560_HW1 - Katie Pham

This program is a mentimeter game simulation where 20 students answer 3 questions with 4 options each. It utilizes object oriented programming principles to count the results of the students' answers. The second question has multiple correct solutions, so the dSimulationDriver code and VotingService class handles that case accordingly.

The iVote interface has the method signatures from VotingService that will be used throughout the program such as displaying results and voting mechanisms.
